// Package ast provides a generic language ast (abstract syntax tree) which builds the base for
// a transpiler model for emitting code in different programming languages. However, the reading transformation
// is very limited and intentionally limited to produce from a higher level including types and even entire
// fixed-function blocks from a custom standard library.
